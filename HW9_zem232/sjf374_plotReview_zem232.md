## Review of sjf374's urban visualization.
For this assignment, sjf374 decided to visualize the number of registered in dogs in New York City neighborhoods with a choropleth.

**Effective** 
This plot is very clear, easy to read, and the information you are trying to convey is done correctly. The bright yellow contrasts well against the deep purple and is easy to know that those regions have the highest dog ownership.

**Aesthetics**
Very pleased with the aesthetics - I really like the chosen color scheme against the white background. A color map that was color-blind sensitive was selected.

**Plot Descriptors** 
Everything is clearly indicated (legend, title, etc.). My only suggestion is to add a caption that indicates where you obtained the data, your methods, a brief summary of your findings and analysis as well as some potential commentary on limitations of the plot, or how it can be used.
