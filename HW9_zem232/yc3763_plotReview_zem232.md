### Review of yc3763's urban visualization.

For this assignment, yc3763 chose to visualize the median family income for families in New York City with a choropleth.

**Aesthetics**
150% pleased with the aesthetics - I really like the chosen color scheme contrasted to the seaborn gray background.
While cyan and magenta do get confused for color-impaired vision (deuteranopia & protanopia), the color map factor in the magnitude of color so the effects can still be distinguished easily for any color-sensitive people and if the plot were converted to gray scale (e.g. printed in b&w)

**Plot Descriptors**
The most notable comment is that the legend indicating what the color/color intensities correspond to is missing. The x and y ticks are not necessary since this is clearly a plot of NYC, maybe you can remove them entirely since the numbers may confuse people, especially if they are expecting lat/long coordinates.You should also include a figure description indicating what the plot shows, where the data comes from, and potential limitations/biases, or other information you may deem relevant.

**Effective**
I'd say this plot effectively conveys the information you are trying to convey, as long as you add in the appropriate plot descriptors as indicated above. The graph is clear, sized correctly, used an appropriate datum, and there are no obstructing excentricities.
Overall, good job!
