Plot Review by Muci Yu my1826

Note: Reviewing "Visualizing Spread of Delis/Groceries and Socioeconomic Factors in Neighborhoods of Brooklyn"

CLARITY: The plot is very clear and easy to read. However, they are missing some key information such as the legend. It is very important; otherwise, people will not know what dark/bright colors stand for. Also, it might be helpful to point out the locations on the maps, since not every reader is familiar with the geography of Brooklyn.

ESTHETIC: The graphs are aesthetically beautiful. The color scheme is perfect.

HONESTY: You might consider take population/size into account for the two maps on top, since it may not be fair to compare the number of Delis for neighborhoods with different population. 

In conclusion, to improve your plot, I would suggest to add legend and location text to the maps. Also, you may want to consider normalize the number of delis by population/size of neighborhoods.
