** TOOK THE 72-HOUR extension for this homework ***

### Part 1: Urban Data Visualization Peer Review

See the attached Plot Review markdown files in this repo for my attempt at an insightful review of other peer visualizations.

### Part 2: Linear Regression using Statsmodels

In this exercise, we practiced the use of the python package statsmodels to produce a linear regression.
Refer to the python notebook titled HW9_zem232_Part2.ipynb in this repo. I worked on this notebook by myself, with the help from stack overflow for various things. 


### Part 3: Linear Regression Application: Investigating fire arm posession, gun violence & GDP

Applying the linear regression model to investigate gun-related activity in countries for the year 2012.
Refer to HW9_zem232_Part3.ipynb. I worked on this homework by myself, again with minor help from stack overflow for inspiration.
